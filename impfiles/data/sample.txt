            At times, it becomes very handy to have a free word count tool which can give a person an idea or an overview of the text he or she has written. Such needs may arise when a person is working in the field of academics, who must write research papers, articles, journals or assignments, as a student. Normally everyone is limited by a word count in his practice by the target rules or acceptance guidance of some magazine or internet blog.
